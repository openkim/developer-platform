The aflow++ software prioritizes interoperability, minimizing the number of independent parameters and tolerances. It ensures consistency of results across property sets \\u2014 facilitating machine learning studies. The software also features various validation schemes, offering real-time quality assurance for data generated in a high-throughput fashion.

The driver is written in C++ and implements three styles of modified embedded atom method (MEAM) potentials, `meam`, `meam/spline`, and `meam/sw/spline`. The style of the potential is automatically detected based on the input files to the driver. The input files are ASCII text files formatted to be consistent with the other MD codes that implement MEAM potentials, such as LAMMPS, serial DYNAMO code, and Warp. For any of the three styles mentioned above, the driver expects an element file. Depending on the specific potential style, other files may be required/supplied (a library and/or a parameter file for a `meam` style, and a potential file for a `meam/spline`, or `meam/sw/spline` style.)",

Previously published MEAM parameters of single elements have been improved for a better agreement to the generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) curves when compared with ab initio generated GSFE curves. The MEAM parameters for element pairs were constructed based on the structural and elastic properties of element pairs in the NaCl reference structure garnered from ab initio calculations, with adjustment to reproduce the ab initio heat of formation of the most stable binary compounds. The new MEAM potentials were validated by comparing the formation energies of defects, equilibrium volumes, elastic moduli, and heat of formation for several binary compounds with ab initio simulations and experiments. Single elements in their ground-state crystal structure were subjected to heating to test the potentials at elevated temperatures. An Al potential was modified to avoid the formation of an unphysical solid structure at high temperatures. The thermal expansion coefficient of a compound with the composition of AA 6061 alloy was evaluated and compared with experimental values. MEAM potential tests performed in this work, utilizing the universal atomistic simulation environment (ASE), are distributed to facilitate reproducibility of the results.",

Recent rapid proliferation of computational data on materials properties presents the possibility to complement and extend the databases where the experimental data is lacking or difficult to obtain. Enhanced repositories that integrate both computational and empirical approaches open novel opportunities for structure discovery and optimization, including uncovering of unsuspected compounds, metastable structures and correlations between various characteristics. The practical realization of these opportunities depends on a systematic compilation and classification of the generated data in addition to an accessible interface for the materials science community. In this paper we present an extensive repository, aflowlib.org, comprising phase-diagrams, electronic structure and magnetic properties, generated by the high-throughput framework AFLOW. This continuously updated compilation currently contains over 150,000 thermodynamic entries for alloys, covering the entire composition range of more than 650 binary systems, 13,000 electronic structure analyses of inorganic compounds, and 50,000 entries for novel potential magnetic and spintronics systems. The repository is available for the scientific community on the website of the materials research consortium, aflowlib.org.",

The aflow++ software prioritizes interoperability, minimizing the number of independent parameters and tolerances. It ensures consistency of results across property sets \\u2014 facilitating machine learning studies. The software also features various validation schemes, offering real-time quality assurance for data generated in a high-throughput fashion.

Recent rapid proliferation of computational data on materials properties presents the possibility to complement and extend the databases where the experimental data is lacking or difficult to obtain. Enhanced repositories that integrate both computational and empirical approaches open novel opportunities for structure discovery and optimization, including uncovering of unsuspected compounds, metastable structures and correlations between various characteristics. The practical realization of these opportunities depends on a systematic compilation and classification of the generated data in addition to an accessible interface for the materials science community. In this paper we present an extensive repository, aflowlib.org, comprising phase-diagrams, electronic structure and magnetic properties, generated by the high-throughput framework AFLOW. This continuously updated compilation currently contains over 150,000 thermodynamic entries for alloys, covering the entire composition range of more than 650 binary systems, 13,000 electronic structure analyses of inorganic compounds, and 50,000 entries for novel potential magnetic and spintronics systems. The repository is available for the scientific community on the website of the materials research consortium, aflowlib.org.",

The style of the potential is automatically detected based on the input files to the driver. The input files are ASCII text files formatted to be consistent with the other MD codes that implement MEAM potentials, such as LAMMPS, serial DYNAMO code, and Warp. For any of the three styles mentioned above, the driver expects an element file. Depending on the specific potential style, other files may be required/supplied (a library and/or a parameter file for a `meam` style, and a potential file for a `meam/spline`, or `meam/sw/spline` style.)",

Previously published MEAM parameters of single elements have been improved for a better agreement to the generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) curves when compared with ab initio generated GSFE curves. The MEAM parameters for element pairs were constructed based on the structural and elastic properties of element pairs in the NaCl reference structure garnered from ab initio calculations, with adjustment to reproduce the ab initio heat of formation of the most stable binary compounds. The new MEAM potentials were validated by comparing the formation energies of defects, equilibrium volumes, elastic moduli, and heat of formation for several binary compounds with ab initio simulations and experiments. Single elements in their ground-state crystal structure were subjected to heating to test the potentials at elevated temperatures. An Al potential was modified to avoid the formation of an unphysical solid structure at high temperatures. The thermal expansion coefficient of a compound with the composition of AA 6061 alloy was evaluated and compared with experimental values. MEAM potential tests performed in this work, utilizing the universal atomistic simulation environment (ASE), are distributed to facilitate reproducibility of the results.",
