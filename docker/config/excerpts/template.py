"""
Holds the templating logic for the kim preprocessor

We utilize jinja2 templating to expose certain functions to the templating
functionality of the pipeline.  As of this version, the following functions
are available

    * query(query) - run a general API query to query.openkim.org for any information
        including test results or reference data.  See query.openkim.org for
        information on formatting these queries
    * MODELNAME - a global variable which represents the name of the current running Model.
    * TESTNAME - the name of the current running Test, similar to MODELNAME.
    * VCNAME - the name of the current running Verification Check, similar to TESTNAME.
    * SUBJECTNAME, RUNNERNAME - alternatives to MODELNAME and TESTNAME
    * path(kim_code) - gives the path of the corresponding kim_code;
        the executable if its a test or a test driver, and the folder otherwise
    * convert(value, srcunit, dstunit) - convert a floating point value from
        one unit to another
    * asedata - the dictionary of reference data contained within ASE

    Intercept any queries performed in pipeline.stdin.tpl. If these queries are to the 'data' database, we

    out this procedure.  In the event that 'fields' is blank, we do not need to add 'meta.uuid' (and, in fact,
